           <h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
<ol><li>Preparation: Start by wetting your face with lukewarm water. Ensure your hands are clean.</li>
<li>Dispense the Product: Squeeze a small amount of the face wash onto your fingertips. A little goes a long way.</li>
<li>Application: Gently apply the product to your wet face. Use circular, upward motions to work the foam into your skin. Avoid harsh rubbing, as this can irritate the skin</li>
<li>4. Massage: Continue to massage the face wash into your skin for about 20-30 seconds. Pay attention to areas prone to clogged pores or dullness.
</li>
<li>Avoid Eye Area: Be cautious not to get the product into your eyes. If it comes into contact with your eyes, rinse thoroughly with water.</li>
<li>Rinse Thoroughly: After massaging, thoroughly rinse your face with lukewarm water. Ensure all traces of the face wash are removed.</li>
<li>Pat Dry: Gently pat your face dry with a clean, soft towel. Avoid harsh rubbing, as this can cause skin irritation.</li>
<li>Follow Up: For optimal results, follow up with a suitable moisturizer if needed. If it's daytime, remember to apply CureoSkin Broad Spectrum Sunscreen as recommended.</li>
<li>Frequency: Depending on your skin type and concerns, use the face wash in your daily skincare routine. However, if you have sensitive skin, it's advisable to start with every other day to gauge how your skin responds.</li>
<li>Storage: Store the product in a cool, dry place and keep the cap tightly</li></ol>
